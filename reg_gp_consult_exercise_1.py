# Exercise 1: Build a DES model in SimPy, of the below system. Run for 8 hours of simulated time
# Add functionality to the model to calculate and print the mean queuing times for each of the
# three queues, along with the mean time in system (from point of arrival to the surgery, to point
# of departure). For extra points, additionally plot a bar chart showing these times.
#
# You have 1 hour (+ 5 minutes comfort break). Work in your groups

# Exercise 2
# Extend the DES model you built in Exercise 1 to include:
# - calls coming in to reception on average every 10 minutes, and which last an average of 4 minutes,
# answered by the receptionist. Don't worry about adding any results for call queues, or adding these
# calls to times in systems results. We just want to model the drain on the receptionist resource for
# other activities (registering patients and booking tests)
# - a warm up period of 3 hours before the 8 hours results collection period
# - functionality to run the simulation multiple times - have the simulation run 100 times, with average
# results taken over these runs
# 
# You have been asked by the GP surgery staff to use your model to make recommendations
# for resourcing to try to get the average time a person spends in the surgery to no more than
# around 30 minutes. What recommendations would you make? You have 40 minutes. We'll share the 
# solution at the end of this session
# 
# ANSWER
# After modeling the system, we discover that adding one extra receptionist and one extra 
# gp would significantly reduce the time a patient spends in the surgery

# Exercise 1 Approach
# INPUTS (simulation time = 8 x 60 = 480 mins, mean_arrival_time = 3 mins, mean registration time = 2 mins, 
# mean consultation time = 8 mins, mean booking test time = 4 mins, percentage of those who book test = 25%,
# percentage who leave system without booking test = 75%, Resources: 1 receptionist, 2 gps)
# OUTPUTS (mean queing time for registration queue, mean queing time for consultation queue, mean
# queuing time for book test queue, mean time in the system (point of arrival to point of departure), plot bar for these times)

# Exercise 2 Approach
# INPUTS (c_inter = 10 min, mean_call_time = 4 min, receptionist, warm_up_period = 3x60 mins, simulation_run_times=100, consider
# average results for these runs), model drain on the recepionist resource
