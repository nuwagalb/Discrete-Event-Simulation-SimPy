# CONTAINERS
# So far, we've considered resources as being discrete identifiable
# entities. But what if our resource was continous, or if we wanted
# to model a homogenous mass of resource.
# For example, imagine we were modelling the fuelling of a car, and
# our resource was petrol
# Or maybe rather than model number of nurses, we want to model
# simultaneous nurse time in use, from which we take from and add
# back to a pool of time as incoming activity fluctuates.
# In SimPy, rather than use the Resource class, we can use the 
# Container class for these kinds of problems
